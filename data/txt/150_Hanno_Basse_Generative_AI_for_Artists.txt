Stability AI's aim is to liberate artists of all trades from the repetitive, mechanical aspects of their work and help them spend the majority of their time on the creative side. So our highest hope for next year is that generative AI will help people to be more creative and productive.

In addition, I hope the AI community will focus on:

Safety and integrity:  Building safe products by embedding integrity from the earliest stages of development, ensuring the technology is used responsibly and makes a meaningful contribution to the art of storytelling. Accessibility:  Generative AI products and tools must be accessible and usable for the broadest possible audience. Currently, much of generative AI remains  accessible primarily to individuals who have advanced technical expertise, such as engineers. To address this, we need to develop much better tooling on top of foundational models, so they provide value to a diverse audience. Customization:  Looking ahead, we expect generative AI to become increasingly specialized. Alongside large foundational models, we expect a significant rise in smaller, fine-tuned models tailored for specific and often quite narrow use cases and applications, even down to the level of a single task. This is where the true potential of generative AI will come to bear. Moreover, it is the safest and most responsible way to deploy generative AI in the real world.
